      It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life. When a
      person leads a disciplined life, they set an easy path to success. They
      will develop an approach to happiness and a beautiful future ahead. Being
      disciplined is the practice of having a scheduled daily routine which
      helps an individual to be punctual and hard-working. An individual is
      taught what being disciplined means from the time they are young. Even
      though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of a disciplined
      life make it a worthwhile endeavour
